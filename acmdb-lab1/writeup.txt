Describe any design decisions you made.

I use HashMap to find an entry based on some 'name', and use the raw Java array rather than ArrayList for immutable lists.

Dicuss and justify any changes you mode to the API.

In TupleDesc, I add a constructer with parameters (TDItem[]). As the constructor is private, it is not exposed to other parts, and is only used for TupleDesc::merge.

Describe any missing or imcomplete elements of your code.

My code catches up with all the requirements in Lab-1.

Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.

I spent about 5 hours. I find Java is a somehow stupid language. Stream in Java 8 is a good tool for functional programming, but its API is also a little annoying.
